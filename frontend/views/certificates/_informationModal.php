                <p>The transaction number requested for the establishment of the ECTN results from a new procedure in force in Cameroon at the level of the Single Window in place.
                    Any importer wishing to make a shipment must first obtain this transaction number free of charge by creating a tracking record of his shipment at Douala. Once this procedure is done, a transaction number (PRxxxxxx)is generated and the importer must communicate it to the shipper for the establishment of the ECTN in order to link it to its record previously created in Douala.</p>
